# About This Project
The purpose of this project is to deliver tools that support production and consumption
of HL7 and flat file formats used to communicate COVID-19 vaccination data between IIS
and CDC to support tracking of vaccination progress for COVID-19.

Files included in this project are listed below.

#[[##]]# CDC Specifications
The specifications from which this project was originally developed included in this site:

* [CDC Specifications for the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Reporting Specification v2 (Excel)](https://github.com/CDCGov/CDC_IIS_Open_Tools/blob/release_${project.version}/doc/CDC_COVID-19_Vaccination_Reporting_Specification_v2_CLEARED_20201029.xlsx)
* [CDC CVRS_What's New in Version 2 (Word)](https://github.com/CDCGov/CDC_IIS_Open_Tools/blob/release_${project.version}/doc/CDC_CVRS_What's_New_in_Version_2_CLEARED_20201028.docx)
* [CDC CVRS Instructions v2 (Word)](https://github.com/CDCGov/CDC_IIS_Open_Tools/blob/release_${project.version}/doc/CDC_CVRS_Instructions_v2_CLEARED_20201028.docx)

#[[##]]# [Scripts](Upload.html)
The [scripts](https://github.com/CDCGov/CDC_IIS_Open_Tools/tree/release_${project.version}/scripts) folder contains scripts that can be used to support file uploads.
These scripts rely on [CURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) (pronounced either as C-U-R-L or
"curl" as in the wave curls), a widely available command line tool for interacting
with WEB APIs.

#[[##]]# Java Code
Java code and documentation are included that support validation of flat files and HL7 Version 2 Messages.

#[[###]]# [Validator](Validator.html)

The Validator is a command line tool and collection of Java classes that can be used
to support validation and conversion.

Validator is implemented in the `com.ainq.izgateway.extract.Validator` class and has
a command line interface described in the [Validator](Validator.html) description page.

The validation tool can also be used to convert between the CVRS Tab-Delimited format and HL7 Version 2 format.
See [File Conversions](Converting.html) for more details.

#[[###]]# [Sender](Sender.html)
Sender is a simple file uploader that will send CVRSExtract files to the COVID-19 Clearinghouse Test
(or other designated) endpoint.  It requires test endpoint credentials in order to function.

#[[###]]# [Mock](Mock.html)
Mock is a mock server implementing parts of the COVID-19 Clearinghouse API to support automation testing
within the local system.


#[[##]]# Sample Messages and Flat Files
These are sample messages and flat files containing various forms of the CVRS Data for
testing.

#[[##]]# Value Set Tables
Value Set tables used for content validation. These are simple space delimited files
containing the code in the first field and additional helpful data in remaining fields.
